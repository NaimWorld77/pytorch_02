The essence of machine learning and deep learning is to take some data from the past, build an algorithm (like a neural network)
to discover patterns in it and use the discovered patterns to predict the future.
I coverd in this basic project is:
1. Getting Data (create some dummy data)
2. Build a neural network (build a model to work with dummy data i created)
3. Fit the data to the model (after building our model we fit the dummy data to the model for training)
4. Make prediction and evaluate our model performance (testing model with test data)
5. Save the model (save the model so that we can use it in future)
Here i work with some basic pytorch module. if you want to learn pytorch please follow step by step this project.
Thank you.
